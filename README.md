# Project Overview

This project is a simple HTML and CSS-based webpage that showcases a futuristic design with animated elements. The webpage is divided into two main sections, each containing nested boxes with hover effects and animations.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the webpage and includes animations.

## index.html

The `index.html` file sets up the basic structure of the webpage. It includes links to external resources such as fonts and icons, and it references the `style.css` file for styling. The body of the HTML contains two main sections: `.home_page_left` and `.home_page_right`, each containing nested boxes.

### Key Sections

- **Header**: The header section is currently commented out. It includes a title and navigation links.
- **Home Page**: The main content of the webpage is divided into two sections, `.home_page_left` and `.home_page_right`. Each section contains nested boxes with classes like `.home_page_box`, `.home_page_box2`, etc.

### JavaScript

A small script is included to add the `permanent-hover` class to the boxes when the DOM content is loaded. This class triggers the hover effects defined in the CSS.

## style.css

The `style.css` file contains the styles for the webpage. It includes basic styles for the body and HTML elements, as well as more complex styles for the nested boxes and animations.

### Key Styles

- **Global Styles**: Basic styles for all elements, including margin, padding, and box-sizing.
- **Body and HTML**: Styles for the body and HTML elements, including font, color, and background settings.
- **Home Page**: Styles for the `.home_page` class and its nested elements. This includes flexbox settings for centering content and hover effects for the boxes.
- **Animations**: Keyframe animations for `shadowPulse`, `neonGlow`, and `blink` effects.

### Animations

- **shadowPulse**: Creates a pulsing shadow effect.
- **neonGlow**: Adds a glowing text effect.
- **blink**: Creates a blinking background effect.
